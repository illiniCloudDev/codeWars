// You will be given an array a and a value x. All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value.

// Array can contain numbers or strings. X can be either.

// Return true if the array contains the value, false if not.

//My solution below

function check(arr, value) {
    //we need a loop
    //we need to compare array element with value
    //a conditional if it is not true
    return arr.includes(value) // we used the include method to determine if the variable was present in boolean
  }
